Place script in the same folder containing the email documents.

**To execute the script, go to the folder and use the command in the command line:**

*python search_email.py query index_file directory*

where query is the text to be searched, index_file is the name of the file created by the indexer (if already exists; else the indexer runs and creates the index file), and directory is the name of the folder containing the email documents

The index file may be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVBPvW49avcjNyIEBjHX06MbIBJfP-K_/view?usp=sharing
